# 👋 Hi, I'm Heemansh Bhawsar

I'm a developer who loves building, breaking, and automating things.  
Currently diving deep into **Go**, while Python has been my trusted sidekick for over 4 years.

I used to play a lot of games as a kid (Still Do) and always wandered if i could build something like that. In High School i watched the movie "The Social Network" which finally gave me the initial motivation to learn programming. Started learning Python and that was it, I was hooked. (I use Linux btw)
